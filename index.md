# Team-O-Matic 2025

## Senior Capstone Project Hub

### Overview

This repository serves as the central hub for all project files, documentation, and resources for our senior capstone project.

---

## Project Overview

**Team-O-Matic** is developing a modular battery swapping system designed to enable zero-emission, continuous operations for high-duty-cycle industries such as shipping ports, airports, rail yards, and manufacturing facilities. Unlike traditional electric vehicle charging that requires hours of downtime, our system enables battery swaps in under 90 seconds, allowing vehicles to operate 24/7 without interruption.

### Key Features

- **Rapid Battery Swapping** - Under 90 seconds swap time
- **Zero-Emission Operations** - Complete elimination of diesel emissions
- **24/7 Continuous Operation** - No downtime for charging
- **Industrial-First Design** - Purpose-built for heavy-duty operations
- **Modular Architecture** - Scalable across multiple vehicle types and industries
