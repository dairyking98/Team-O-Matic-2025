- **Communication**
- **Accountability**
- **Adaptability / Compromising**
- **Acceptance of people and ideas**
- **Respect**
- **Support**
- **Fairness**

### 2. How will these values be reflected in our team's behaviors?

- **Communicate** - Establish a line of communication
- **Make reasonable goals**
- **Be comfortable with an idea not becoming reality**
- **Adopting a team mentality**
- **Respecting people and their ideas as they are**
- **Be supportive and treat people fairly**

### 3. What do we need from each other to work well together?

Think about both how you would and would not want one another to behave.

- Communication
- Respect
- Clear goals and timeline

### 4. What is the best way to give each other feedback?

Direct, in the moment, and clearly goal-oriented.

## Roles and Responsibilities

### 1. What are our individual skills and strengths that we can contribute to the team?

- **Ben** - Hardware and control, building + hands-on skills
- **Mohammed** - Solidworks + design
- **Sam** - Microcontroller processing and digital signal processing + hands on
- **Leonard** - Hands on fabrication, plastic, metal, welding. 3D modeling + Fusion 360. Circuitry and microcontrollers. Use of AI for process efficiency such as programming.

### 2. What are areas for growth we each want to explore while we contribute to the team?

- **Ben** - Timeline management + project scope
- **Mohammed** - More hands on experience with prototyping
- **Sam** - Learning the fabrication side
- **Leonard** - Learning about AI / algorithmic machine learning and control systems

### 3. What are our individual responsibilities? What different formal roles should we have to have a successful team?

- **Sam** - Will lead the scheduling and sort of those tasks, but as the group progresses more clear roles will emerge. The leader position is not "in-charge", simply making sure the group is on-task. He will also handle any circuit simulations.

- **Leonard** - Will take on the role of chief tinkerer. This can be described as doing or aiding in CAD designs, choosing or suggesting design and material choices.

- **Ben** - Will handle deadline management. Keep deadlines in mind and the team focused on long term goals as well as regular meetups.

- **Mohammed** - Will be the head of testing and subsystem integration.

## Operating Procedures: Team Meetings

### 1. How will we approach ensuring our meetings are properly planned and facilitated?

Discord, a scheduled meeting on Thursdays at 8 pm.

### 2. What are our expectations around preparedness, attendance, and timelines?

Be there, on time, or let people know if you won't.

### 3. Where will we consolidate our work (e.g. meeting notes, research notes, slides)?

Shared Google Drive folder, and all discussions and important messages conducted and saved in Discord.

## Operating Procedures: Communication and Decision-Making

### 1. How will we ensure everyone on the team is heard?

Accountability, and calling it out when someone isn't being heard. Making sure that criticism is properly constructive.

### 2. What is the best way to communicate with each other? What do we agree as reasonable response times?

Discord.

## Operating Procedures: Conflict

### 1. How will we resolve disagreements?

Group votes on project disagreements. Personal disagreements should be recognized by the group and moved past.

### 2. How will we communicate if we feel our agreed upon expectations are not being met?

Calling it out if you feel comfortable, otherwise discussing with the group leader for a larger conversation.

## Other Topics to Consider

### 1. How will we track individual and team progress?

We will establish a timeline channel on the discord specifically to track progress. Each member will check in on that thread to keep teammates apprised of how they are doing.

We will then begin to incorporate a Gantt chart to plan all short and long term goals, and to track individual and group tasks required to accomplish said goals.

### 2. How and when will we celebrate our accomplishments?

Constantly celebrate the small victories. For larger accomplishments, we will celebrate with snacks or other types of dopamine-inducing rewards.

### 3. What decisions will we make as a team and how will we keep track of decisions made?

We trust and expect our team members to be cognizant of the weight of any decisions and changes to the work, and depending on the weight, will act accordingly in one of the three manners:

- **Heavy Weight**: No changes to be made until the situation is addressed to the team, and all members provide an input until a consensus is reached.

- **Light Weight**: A change may or may not be made. A message is sent to the team to notify of the change, or that a change may or should be considered. The change must be documented.

- **No Weight**: The change, should it be made, provides no negative impact on the team. For instance, a capitalization correction in a report.
