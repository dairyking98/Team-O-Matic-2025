## Critical Path Analysis

### Critical Path (Must Complete On Time)
1. **Design & CAD** (Days 3-5) → Blocks procurement
2. **BOM Finalization** (Days 4-6) → Blocks procurement
3. **Component Procurement** (Days 8-9) → Blocks all fabrication
4. **Boom Crane Fabrication** (Days 11-13) → Blocks integration
5. **Control System Development** (Days 18-20) → Blocks testing
6. **Testing & Optimization** (Days 22-24) → Blocks documentation

### Risk Mitigation
- **Procurement Delays:** Order components early, have backup vendors identified
- **Fabrication Issues:** Build in buffer time, have simplified backup design ready
- **Control System Complexity:** Start with basic sequences, iterate
- **Integration Problems:** Test subsystems independently before integration
- **Time Constraints:** Prioritize core functionality over polish

  4. Retract and move to storage position
  5. Place old battery in storage
  6. Pick up new battery
  7. Approach vehicle position
  8. Insert new battery
  9. Lock battery in place
  10. Disengage gripper

## Notes

- This timeline assumes 4 weeks of focused work with regular team meetings
- Buffer time is built into each phase to account for unexpected issues
- Team should meet weekly (Thursdays 8pm per team charter) to review progress
- Critical decisions should be made as a team per team charter guidelines
- All design changes must be documented per team charter decision-making process
