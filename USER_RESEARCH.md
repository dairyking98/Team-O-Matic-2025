# User Research

**Class:** ENGR696-03  
**Professor:** Dr. Mejia  
**Team Name:** Team-o-Matic  
**Team Members:** Leonard Chau, Ben Grimes, Samuel Zimmerickers, Mohammed Azam  
**Date:** October 20, 2025

## Likert Scale Questions

### Q1
**Target Audience:** Fleet Operators

**Question:** I would trust my vehicle to automatically handle the battery alignment process.

**Intent:** Assess operator comfort and trust in automated mechanical alignment systems. If trust is low, the design may prioritize manual alignment options.

---

### Q2
**Target Audience:** Fleet Operators, Port Managers

**Question:** A battery swap time of 5 minutes for a full recharge of equipment would be considered an improvement than current equipment setups.

**Intent:** Evaluate whether the proposed five-minute swap time is perceived as a meaningful performance improvement.

---

### Q3
**Target Audience:** Fleet Operators, Port Managers

**Question:** An electrified fleet with continuous uptime capability would increase throughput and overall productivity.

**Intent:** Determine perceived value of an always-available electric fleet on operational efficiency.

---

### Q4
**Target Audience:** Port Managers, Distribution Center and Warehouse Managers

**Question:** Emissions regulations and standards currently limit our productivity or throughput.

**Intent:** Identify how strongly emissions restrictions impact operations, whether zero-emission systems could alleviate these bottlenecks, and whether the system of our design is desirable across several industries.

---

### Q5
**Target Audience:** Fleet Operators, Port Managers

**Question:** An electrified fleet with continuous uptime capability would create a healthier and safer workplace.

**Intent:** Assess attitudes toward workplace health and safety benefits associated with electric, zero-emission equipment.

---

## Open-Ended Questions

### OEQ1
**Target Audience:** Port, distribution center, and warehouse employees.

**Question:** Do you currently use mobile refueling vehicles or a centralized hub, and what footprint does that currently take up?

**Intent:** Inform hub design and layout by understanding existing fueling logistics and spatial requirements familiar to operators.

---

### OEQ2
**Target Audience:** Fleet operators, Port Managers, Distribution Center and Warehouse Managers

**Question:** What challenges or drawbacks do you anticipate when considering a transition to an electric fleet?

**Intent:** Identify potential barriers to adoption and guide design decisions to mitigate user concerns.

---

### OEQ3
**Target Audience:** Fleet Operators, Port Managers

**Question:** What types of vehicles or applications within your operations would most benefit from a modular battery-swapping system?

**Intent:** Discover specific vehicle types or operational niches best suited for early adoption of this technology.
