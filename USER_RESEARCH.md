# User Research

**Class:** ENGR696-03  
**Professor:** Dr. Mejia  
**Team Name:** Team-o-Matic  
**Team Members:** Leonard Chau, Ben Grimes, Samuel Zimmerickers, Mohammed Azam  
**Date:** October 20, 2025

## Likert Scale Questions

### Q1
**Target Audience:** Fleet Operators

**Question:** I would trust my vehicle to automatically handle the battery alignment process.

**Intent:** Assess operator comfort and trust in automated mechanical alignment systems. If trust is low, the design may prioritize manual alignment options.

---

### Q2
**Target Audience:** Fleet Operators, Port Managers

**Question:** A battery swap time of 5 minutes for a full recharge of equipment would be considered an improvement than current equipment setups.

**Intent:** Evaluate whether the proposed five-minute swap time is perceived as a meaningful performance improvement.

---

### Q3
**Target Audience:** Fleet Operators, Port Managers

**Question:** An electrified fleet with continuous uptime capability would increase throughput and overall productivity.

**Intent:** Determine perceived value of an always-available electric fleet on operational efficiency.

---

### Q4
**Target Audience:** Port Managers, Distribution Center and Warehouse Managers

**Question:** Emissions regulations and standards currently limit our productivity or throughput.

**Intent:** Identify how strongly emissions restrictions impact operations, whether zero-emission systems could alleviate these bottlenecks, and whether the system of our design is desirable across several industries.

---

### Q5
**Target Audience:** Fleet Operators, Port Managers

**Question:** An electrified fleet with continuous uptime capability would create a healthier and safer workplace.

**Intent:** Assess attitudes toward workplace health and safety benefits associated with electric, zero-emission equipment.

---

## Open-Ended Questions

### OEQ1
**Target Audience:** Port, distribution center, and warehouse employees.

**Question:** Do you currently use mobile refueling vehicles or a centralized hub, and what footprint does that currently take up?

**Intent:** Inform hub design and layout by understanding existing fueling logistics and spatial requirements familiar to operators.

---

### OEQ2
**Target Audience:** Fleet operators, Port Managers, Distribution Center and Warehouse Managers

**Question:** What challenges or drawbacks do you anticipate when considering a transition to an electric fleet?

**Intent:** Identify potential barriers to adoption and guide design decisions to mitigate user concerns.

---

### OEQ3
**Target Audience:** Fleet Operators, Port Managers

**Question:** What types of vehicles or applications within your operations would most benefit from a modular battery-swapping system?

**Intent:** Discover specific vehicle types or operational niches best suited for early adoption of this technology.

---

## Survey Responses

### Port Manager Perspective

#### Likert Scale Responses

##### Q1 — Likert Scale
**Statement:** I would trust my vehicle to automatically handle the battery alignment process.

**Answer:** Neutral

**Reasoning:** Automation is promising, but ports are harsh environments—dust, corrosion, vibration, and operator error are common. Autonomous alignment would need to be extremely robust and fail-safe. I'd want override controls and a manual backup.

---

##### Q2 — Likert Scale
**Statement:** A battery swap time of 5 minutes for a full recharge of equipment would be considered an improvement over current equipment setups.

**Answer:** Strongly Agree

**Reasoning:** Diesel refueling is fast, but charging is significantly slower. If a swap can be completed in ~5 minutes without bottlenecks, that's a major productivity advantage.

**Q2b — Maximum Acceptable Swap Time**

**Answer:** 3–5 minutes

If it starts taking longer than 5 minutes, the benefit over diesel refueling disappears. Downtime costs money, especially during peak hours.

---

##### Q3 — Likert Scale
**Statement:** An electrified fleet with continuous uptime capability would increase throughput and overall productivity.

**Answer:** Agree

**Reasoning:** Less maintenance, no warm-up time, fewer breakdowns, and predictable energy use could improve fleet reliability. However, system reliability must be proven first.

---

##### Q4 — Likert Scale
**Statement:** Emissions regulations and standards currently limit our productivity or throughput.

**Answer:** Neutral

**Reasoning:** We comply with Tier 4 / CA emissions rules, and while they add cost and maintenance complexity, they don't significantly slow operations. Electrification would help long-term, but isn't currently a blocker.

---

##### Q5 — Likert Scale
**Statement:** An electrified fleet with continuous uptime capability would create a healthier and safer workplace.

**Answer:** Strongly Agree

**Reasoning:** Less noise, no diesel fumes, reduced risk of fuel spills. Mechanics also deal with fewer hazardous fluids.

---

#### Open-Ended Responses

##### OEQ1
**Question:** Do you currently use mobile refueling vehicles or a centralized hub?

**Answer:**

We use both. Most yard tractors and forklifts refuel at a centralized fueling station, but we have mobile fuel trucks for overnight shifts and when equipment is staged far from the fueling area. Mobile refueling improves uptime during high-traffic operations.

---

##### OEQ2
**Question:** What footprint does your refueling operation currently take up?

**Answer:**

The main fueling station occupies roughly the size of a small warehouse bay—enough space for two trucks at a time, fuel storage tanks, spill containment, and fire suppression systems. Mobile refueling trucks only need parking space, but safety clearance is required during fueling.

---

##### OEQ3
**Question:** What challenges or drawbacks do you anticipate when considering a transition to an electric fleet?

**Answer:**

- Upfront capital cost of vehicles and charging or swap infrastructure
- Reliability concerns—downtime due to electrical faults or battery issues
- Need for onsite power upgrades or utility infrastructure
- Technicians will need retraining
- Concern about battery lifespan and replacement cost
- Harsh outdoor environments (salt air, moisture, dust) may damage connectors
- Backup plan needed for power outages or grid instability

---

##### OEQ4
**Question:** What types of vehicles or applications would most benefit from a modular battery-swapping system?

**Answer:**

- Yard tractors and hostlers (constant movement, little idle time)
- Forklifts used in 24/7 warehouse loading
- Transport tugs and dollies
- Short-haul drayage trucks that remain onsite
- Cranes or container handlers with frequent duty cycles

Short-distance, high-utilization vehicles benefit most—especially where downtime is costly.

---

#### Feedback to Improve the Survey

As a respondent, here is useful feedback:

**Consider adding questions about:**

- Infrastructure limits: "Do you have the electrical capacity onsite to support an electric fleet?"
- Fleet operating schedules: Day shifts vs. 24/7 operations greatly change requirements.
- Weather & environment: Ports have corrosive salt environments, shocks, and uneven pavement.
- Vehicle interoperability: Would batteries be universal or tied to a single OEM?

**Terminology clarity:**

- Some Likert questions could specify whether "Agree" is about feasibility or desirability (trust vs. performance).

**Add a cost-related question:**

- Would lower maintenance and fuel savings offset the transition cost?
- Would leasing batteries be preferable to owning?

**Add a maintenance/logistics question:**

- Who handles batteries—drivers or maintenance crew?

This would provide more actionable data for design and market adoption.
