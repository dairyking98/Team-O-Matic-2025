## 1. Problem Statement and Background

Current shipping port ground vehicles rely almost entirely on diesel engines for 24-hour operations. This dependency creates high emissions, operational noise, maintenance overhead, and refueling downtime. Existing battery technologies are limited by long charging times, making it incompatible with the continuous workflows of shipping ports. There is a need for a modular energy system that enables zero-emission and continuous operation without disrupting existing logistics.

Many high-duty industries, such as shipping ports, airports, and rail yards, rely on fossil fueled vehicles to maintain 24-hour operations. This dependency creates high emissions, operational noise, and downtime during refueling. Current electric battery technologies are hindered by long charging times, making them incompatible with continuous workflows.

## 2. Proposed Solutions and Design

Our project proposes a modular battery swapping system designed to enable continuous, zero-emission operations without disrupting existing logistics. The initial application focuses on shipping port yard vehicles, serving as a representative use case for broader implementation across other continuous-operation industries.

## 4. Budget Justification

The requested $166.15 will fund critical electronic and mechanical components necessary to build and demonstrate a functional, scaled prototype of our modular battery swapping system. This prototype will serve as the physical platform for validating the feasibility of continuous, zero-emission operation in industrial vehicle applications.

The microcontrollers (Arduino Nano and STM32 NUCLEO board) will serve as the primary control units for the vehicle systems and battery swapping mechanism, while the nRF24L01 RF transceivers enable wireless communication between the vehicle and control station to simulate coordinated port operations.

The drive motors and servo motors will power the scaled vehicle's mobility and steering system, allowing for accurate demonstration of continuous operation scenarios. The Li-ion batteries will represent modular energy packs, designed to be swapped as part of the system's core functionality. Lidar sensors will be used for docking alignment, demonstrating how automated or semi-automated swapping can be achieved in future full-scale applications.

This funding directly supports the core deliverables of the ENGR 696 capstone project, enabling our team to fabricate and demonstrate a complete proof-of-concept system. The use of commercially available off-the-shelf components ensures cost-effectiveness while allowing sufficient flexibility for integration, testing, and iteration during the design phase.
