# Team-O-Matic: Modular Battery Swapping System
## Overall Project Description

**Date:** November 2025  
**Team:** Team-o-Matic  
**Project Duration:** October 2025 - June 2026 (Two Semesters)

---

## Executive Summary

Team-O-Matic is developing a modular battery swapping system designed to enable zero-emission, continuous operations for high-duty-cycle industries such as shipping ports, airports, rail yards, and manufacturing facilities. Unlike traditional electric vehicle charging that requires hours of downtime, our system enables battery swaps in under 90 seconds, allowing vehicles to operate 24/7 without interruption. The system addresses the critical gap between environmental regulations requiring emission reductions and the operational need for continuous vehicle availability.
